# Libft

## Description

Libft is the first foundational project of the 42 curriculum. Its purpose is to recreate essential functions from the standard C library while developing a deeper understanding of memory management, pointers, data structures, and low-level programming concepts.

The project consists of building a custom static library named `libft.a`, which can be reused throughout future 42 projects.

Through this project, I learned how standard library functions work internally and gained practical experience with manual memory management, defensive programming, and software modularization.

---

## Project Overview

The library contains:

- Reimplemented libc functions
- Memory manipulation utilities
- String manipulation functions
- Conversion functions
- File descriptor output functions
- Linked list management utilities

All functions were implemented following the 42 Norm and compiled with:

```bash
-Wall -Wextra -Werror
```

---

## Features

- Custom implementation of standard C library functions
- Safe memory allocation and manipulation
- String processing utilities
- Integer and character conversion utilities
- File descriptor output functions
- Singly linked list implementation
- Modular and reusable architecture
- Norm-compliant source code

---

`libft.a` is a static library designed to provide reusable utility functions for future projects.
